    origin: "West African (Akan people)",
    retelling: "Long ago, Anansi the spider wanted to be the wisest creature in the world. He collected all the wisdom in the world and put it in a large pot. 'I will keep all this wisdom for myself!' he thought. Anansi decided to hide the pot at the top of a tall tree. He tied the pot to his belly and began to climb. But the pot kept getting in his way! He struggled and slipped, unable to climb properly. Anansi's young son, watching from below, called out, 'Father, wouldn't it be easier if you tied the pot to your back instead?' Anansi realized his son was right. Then it struck him—if his young son had wisdom he didn't have, then wisdom couldn't all be in the pot! In frustration, Anansi accidentally dropped the pot, and it shattered. Wisdom scattered all over the world. That's why, to this day, everyone has a little bit of wisdom, and no one person has it all.",
